# RSI Divergance:

A bullish divergence signifies a potential trend reversal, indicating that the downward trend might be losing steam and the price could begin to move upward. Here's a suggested approach for incorporating a bullish divergence into a trading strategy:

1. **Verify the bullish divergence**: Ensure the observed bullish divergence is substantial rather than a minor fluctuation in price or RSI. This can be done by verifying that the price has reached a lower low while the RSI has achieved a higher low over a specified lookback period, as demonstrated in the `detect_rsi_divergence` function provided earlier.

2. **Seek further confirmation**: A bullish divergence on its own may not be enough to initiate a trade. It's advisable to wait for supplementary confirmation signals, such as breaking through a significant resistance level, forming a bullish candlestick pattern, or witnessing other technical indicators like Moving Average Crossovers or MACD surpassing its signal line.

3. **Initiate a long position**: After confirming the bullish divergence and obtaining additional confirmation signals, consider opening a long position (purchasing the asset). Be sure to manage risk by setting an appropriate stop-loss level beneath the recent swing low or another pertinent support level.

4. **Determine a profit target**: Set a profit target for the trade based on factors such as risk-reward ratio, technical analysis, or other considerations. For example, the profit target could be set at the next significant resistance level or a specific percentage above the entry price.

5. **Keep an eye on the trade**: Regularly monitor the trade and be ready to exit the position if market conditions shift or if the price fails to move in the anticipated direction. Employ trailing stop-loss orders or other risk management techniques to secure profits as the price trends favorably.

It's important to remember that every trading strategy involves some degree of risk, and no single indicator or signal guarantees success. Utilizing proper risk management, diversifying strategies, and being prepared to adjust your approach as market conditions evolve are all essential components of successful trading.
